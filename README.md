# Star Rays Generator for Adobe Illustrator

## Overview
The Star Rays Generator is a tool for Adobe Illustrator that lets you create stunning "starburst" line effects. With this script, you can generate random lines radiating from the center of selected objects or the document center, making it ideal for designs requiring dynamic, radiant visuals.

## Features
- Generates random rays with varied colors and lengths.
- Uses stroke colors from selected objects (if available) or applies random colors.
- Works seamlessly with Adobe Illustrator CC 2024 and above.

## Installation
1. Download the `.jsx` file from the repository or release page.
2. Place the file in Illustrator's `Scripts` folder:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator [Version]\Presets\en_US\Scripts`
   - **Mac:** `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator [Version]/Presets/en_US/Scripts`
3. Restart Adobe Illustrator.
4. Access the script from the menu: `File > Scripts > Star Rays Generator`.
5. Alternatively, run the script via `File > Scripts > Other Scripts...` and select the `.jsx` file from your local directory.

## Usage
1. Open your Adobe Illustrator project.
2. Select one or more objects with stroke colors to use their colors for the rays. If no objects are selected, random colors will be used.
3. Run the script from the menu: `File > Scripts > Star Rays Generator`.
4. Watch as random starburst lines radiate from the center of your selection or the document center!

## Examples
- **With Selected Objects:**
  The rays adopt the stroke colors from selected objects. They are drawn from the center of the inividual objects. The dialog will ask you to set the number of rays, line width, opacity and Blending mode.

- **Without Selection:**
  Rays are drawn centered in the document. A dialog will appear, allowing you to set values for the amount of lines, min and max radius, color settings red (R), green (G), and blue (B), line width, opacity and Blending mode.

## Requirements
- Adobe Illustrator CC 2023 or newer.
